                        IIT’s being the top institute of India, IIT Madras has its own place in creating some of the best problem-solving brains. IIT Madras has given me a completely new world to see which I would have never imagined.

                    <p>
                        Being Metallurgy as a major, with a passion in computer’s I thought it would be really hard to get a chance to explore the digital side of world. But IIT Madras has provided a vast number of resources in form of electives to pursue my dreams. The most interesting part of my journey at IIT Madras is the amount of time it provided to explore the world and learn the stuff that you’re passionate about along with a lot of likeminded people who always tries to correct me and support me and come along with me. It’s been a remarkable experience, being a part of Saarang (IITM cultural fest), where I’ve got a chance to learn some of best practices in managing people and learned a great leadership skill. CFI (centre for innovation) at IITM is always my inspiration of any new tech.
